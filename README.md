I'm a second-year CS major translating raw race-car bytes into winning insights for UT Austin's Formula SAE EV Team. At Longhorn Racing I keep a JavaScript • Python • Flask • MQTT real-time ingest tool running and design TypeScript • T3 Stack systems for smarter recruiting. Comfortable with Java • Git • AWS EC2 • TDD, and more, I chase millisecond gains and steep learning curves. My mantra: Iterate • Improve • Deploy. Open to summer 2026 SWE internships—let’s connect!
